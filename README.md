meta-json documentation page builder and JSON schemas
-----------------------------------------------------

Parses meta-json data from a project's source files and creates pretty
documentation pages. This project includes implementations of a
[meta-json](https://github.com/bob-gray/meta-json) builder, processor and reporter.

This project is still very much a work in progress. The details of the schemas
have not be fully fleshed out, final touches of the doc pages markup and
styles have not been completed and the builder does not yet accept arguments (which
it will obviously need to).
